# Spring-Boot-Library
Create a new database in your MySQL Workbench. Call the database **bibliotheek**.
In application.properties you can change your login and password for MySQL if they are not set to **root**.

When you run the application the databse should be populated automatically.

There are **2 test users**. Each of them has a different role:<br/>
**USER:**<br/> 
  username: user<br/>
  password: user<br/>
**ADMIN:**<br/>
  username: admin<br/>
  password: admin
  
  The default language is **Dutch** but if you change your browser language to **English** all pages will be displayed in English.
